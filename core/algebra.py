"""Provides vector and matrix interfaces tailored to the needs of IM analysis.

At the heart of this module is the need to organize multidimensional data (such
as a map which has 3 axes: ra, dec, frequency) as a 1D vector for linear
algebra operations.  However we do not want to lose the multidimensional
organization of the data.  In addition there are efficiencies to be gained by
organizing data in a multidimensional way.  For example, some matrices will
be block diagonal in that they will not couple different frequency bins.  We
would like to exploit this.  To address this, classes are provided that store
data in numpy `ndarray` format but know how to reorganize the data into a
matrix or vector format.  Some basic matrix operations are also provided.

Also fully supported is writing the data to and from disk in a standard,
portable format that can easily be read in another language.  This is based on
numpy's NPY format.  Also fully supported is memory mapping; the ability to
manipulate an array stored on disk as if it was in memory.  This will be very
important as data sets become to large to store in memory and when operations
need to be performed in parallel using SCALAPACK.

Examples
--------

Matrices.

>>> import algebra as al
>>> mat_arr = np.arange(120)
>>> mat_arr.shape = (4, 5, 6)
>>> mat_arr = al.make_mat(mat_arr, row_axes=(0,), col_axes=(1, 2),
...                       axis_names=('mode', 'ra', 'dec'))
>>> mat_arr.row_shape()
(4,)
>>> mat_arr.col_shape()
(5, 6)
>>> mat_arr.mat_shape()
(4, 30)
>>> mat_arr.col_names()
('ra', 'dec')

Vectors.

>>> vect_arr = np.arange(30)
>>> vect_arr.shape = (5, 6)
>>> vect_arr = al.make_vect(vect_arr, axis_names=('ra', 'dec')
>>> vect_arr.mat_shape()
(30,)

Algebra.

>>> new = al.dot(mat_arr, vect_arr)
>>> new.shape
(4,)
>>> isinstance(new, al.vect_array)
True
>>> al.axes

        ----------
        axis_name : str
            Name of the axis for which you are setting the meta data.
            Must match one of the entries of the axes attribute.
        centre : float
            The value of the axis at the centre bin (indexed by n//2),
            where n = self.shape[i] and self.axes[i] is `axis_name`.
        delta : float
            The width of each bin.

    This class comes in two flavours: `vect_array` and `vect_memmap`
    depending on whether the array is stored in memory or on disk.  The raw
    `vect` class is not a valid class by itself.

    The vector representation of the array is the flattend array.

    One of the features that `vect`s implement is named axes.  This allows
    maps to carry axis information with them, among other things.  For
    `vect`s axis names must be unique (This is not true of `mat`s).

    Parameters
    ----------
    input_array : info_array (for vect_array) or info_memmap (for vect_memmap)
        Array to be converted to a vect.
    axis_names : tuple of strings, optional
        The sequence contains the name of each axis.  This sequence will be
        stored in the `axes` attribute.  This parameter is ignored if
        `input_array`'s info attribute already contains the axis names.

class mat(alg_object) :
    """Multidimentional array interpreted as a matrix.
    
    This class gets most of its functionality from the numpy ndarray class.
    In addition it provides support for organizing it's data as a vector.
    This class comes in two flavours: `mat_array` and `mat_memmap`
    depending on whether the array is stored in memory or on disk.  The raw
    `mat` class is not a valid class by itself.

    To make the association between a multidimentional array and a matrix,
    each axis of the array must be identified as varying over either the
    rows or columns of a matrix.  For instance the shape of the array could
    be (3, 5, 7).  We could identify the first axis as a row axis and the
    second two as column axes in which case the matrix would have 3 rows
    and 35 colums.  We generally make the rows axes left of the columns and
    many algorithms assume this.  It is also possible for an axis to be
    identified as both a row and a column, in which case the matrix is
    block diagonal over that axis.  Generally, the block diagonal axes are
    the leftmost.

    Like `vect`s, mats have named axes, however 2 axes may have the same
    name as long as one is identified as a row axis and the other as a col
    axis.

    Parameters
    ----------
    input_array : info_array (for mat_array) or info_memmap (for
                  mat_memmap)
        Array to be converted to a vect.
    row_axes : tuple of ints
        Sequence contains the axis numbers of the array to identify as
        varying over the matrix rows. This sequence is stored in the
        `rows` attribute.  This parameter is ignored if
        `input_array`'s info attribute already contains the rows.
    col_axis : tuple of ints
        Sequence contains the axis numbers of the array to identify as
        varying over the matrix columns. This sequence is stored in the
        `cols` attribute.  This parameter is ignored if
        `input_array`'s info attribute already contains the cols.
    axis_names : tuple of strings, optional
        The sequence contains the name of each axis.  This sequence will be
        stored in the `axes` attribute.  This parameter is ignored if
        `input_array`'s info attribute already contains the axis names.

    Attributes
    ----------
    axes : tuple of strings
        The names of each of the axes of the array.
    rows : tuple of ints
        Which of the array's axes to identify as varying over the matrix
        rows.
