        Parameters
        ----------

    the beam of an instrument (which may be frequency dependant) and provides 
    operations like the convolution of a map with the beam and matrix 
    opertations with the beam.

    This function fixes only the angular parts of the beam.  Along the
    frequency axis, the beam is assumed to be a top hat.  The frequency width
    of the beam is not fixed.  The width of the objects that the beam works
    with is assumed.  This reflects the fact that 21 cm experiments typically
    have essentially perfect frequency resolution and therefore the beam along
    the frequency axis is just a matter of binning.
