    Parameters
    ----------
    Data : DataBlock
        Contains information in a usable format direct from GBT. Bad
        frequencies will be flagged in all polarizations and cal states.
    sigma_thres : int or float
        Any frequency with variance > `sigma_thres` sigmas will be 
        flagged (recursively).
    badness_thres : float
        A `Data` that has more than `badness_thres` frequencies flagged
        (as a fraction) will be considered 'bad'. `0` means that everything
        will be considered bad while `1` means nothing will be. 
    time_cut : int
        How many time bins (as an absolute number) to flag if `Data` has been
        considered 'bad'. See `destroy_time_with_mean_arrays` for more 
        infomation on this.

    Returns
    -------
    badness : bool
        Returns `True` iff a `Data` has been considered 'bad'.
    
    Notes
    -----
    'badness' is when more than a certain fraction of freqs has been flagged
    from `Data`. This certain fraction comes from `badness_thres`. `Data` that
    is 'bad' has a lot of frequencies flagged and this can because a lot of 
    frequencies are actually bad or because there was a blip in time (maybe
    the machine choked for a second).
    If a `Data` gets considered 'bad' then the algorithm tries to find
    something wrong in time (and masks those bad times) and redoes the RFI
    flagging. If there is a significant decrease (5%) in the number of 
    frequencies flagged, then the problem was in time and it uses the mask
    from this second run with bad times flagged. If not, then the `Data` is
    bad either way and it uses the mask from the first run. Increasing the
    `time_cut` in this situation is not recommended since you lose a lot more
    data (there are 10 times as many freq. bins as time bins in `Data`).
