degrade_resolution -- should be done to the map before
unitless -- param file
return_3d -- param file
truncate -- param file
window -- param file

move inverse function out of corr.py -> cosmology.py
push/pull version to work on the plane
remove distinction between batch quadratic data and sims
keep old batch quadratic code intact
compartmentalize database entries for map cleaning run

longer term plans:
