This package contains all map tools.  This is the proper place for modules
pertaining to map making, beams and covariance matrix generation for maps.

There are severl libraries that need to be built for the map making modules 
to work. Building them requires a distribution of cythion as well as f2py 
(which is distributed with numpy).  To build these libraries type the following
from this director:

```bash
python setup.py build_ext --inplace
```
