"""Simple script to read in a GBT fits file and trim it down to make a test
case.

A note on versioning of the test file: I have set up the git repository to
intensionally ignore the output fits file of this script.  That is why it
doesn't show up on git status.  However the testfile is only 2MB, so if could
be versioned.  Alternately, we could version MD5sums of all data files used for
testing, or regression testing.
